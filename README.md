A small C# project to work with events.

## What's this ?
This is a small project to work with delegates...
It would be fun to refactor this in order to be able to test this properly.

## What where the tools used ?
I used C# 4.8 and Rider as my IDE.

## Can I clone this repository ?
Sure, I'll be honored.
